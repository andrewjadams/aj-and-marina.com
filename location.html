Continue along the road past these buildings, following signs for the office and parking area.

        <p>There is a new entrance to Glynwood, with a paved road. The old entrance listed above is still accessible, it's just not paved. The new entrance is off Big Woods Road on Rt. 301. It will come up as "big woods trailhead parking - fahnestock, Phillipstown" in google maps. At the bottom of the road is a large sign that says BIG WOODS TRAILHEAD.
